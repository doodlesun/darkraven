  This is a topic I have been long dwelling on. The implications of working
  with toxic coworkers. Of course, there are different degrees of toxicity and
  not every toxic interaction makes one a toxic coworker. However, I think there
  are clear red flags when dealing with toxic coworkers, and I wanted to explore
  this topic a little further. Oftentimes, people accept that toxic behavior
  is part of their job, and they have to put up with it. Don't get me wrong,
  people have bad days and sometimes say stuff they probably didn't mean. But,
  there are clear signs when behavior is completely out of line and your
  employer might not be responding to it. This could have several reasons - one being
  that the employee is important for this company. Another one might be that it is overlooked
  by the superiors, and they have no clue how bad it is because they don't often interact with said person.
  Honestly, keeping toxic coworkers is a productivity sink and can dampen the spirit of whole teams.
  This article does not provide the best course on how to handle such a situation.
  I just found myself dealing with toxicity in a previous job. So writing about it might help
  me to deal with the past and maybe other people to detect toxic behavior and provide them the courage to speak up.
</p>
<div class="content__subtitle">What is toxicity?</div>
<p>
  I would define toxicity as behavior that seeks to validate oneself by putting
  other people down. Toxic people are oftentimes expressing different behaviors.
  However, I think that a lot of toxic people
  are just unhappy with their current situation and use this toxicity as an outlet for their frustration.
  Toxicity can be a way to relieve stress. I noticed this with myself,
  oftentimes when I am agitated or nervous, I start to become annoying or blame
  my partner for stuff that is irrelevant. When we are stressed, we blame other people and start fights
  just for the sake of it.
</p>
<div class="content__subtitle">No cancel culture</div>
<p>
  I don't want to promote cancel culture with this article, so it might be best to clarify the difference here.
  Toxic behavior is a deliberate behavior that tries to undermine the competence of someone to the benefit of the
  perpetrator. Cancel culture tries to "cancel" a person by getting them fired from their job or through social pressure.
  Because the person said something offending or maybe "non-mainstream". I am not a huge fan of silencing people,
  misinformation should be tackled by more accurate information.
  Mobs that go after controversial figures are becoming more widespread, and I think this is a worrisome development.
  Finally, I am not advocating to cancel toxic people.
  I think everyone has the potential to better themselves. Most are just caught in their habits and
  toxic behaviors.
</p>
  <div class="content__subtitle">An example of toxicity</div>
  <p>
    Now that we have all this definition stuff out of the way I want to give an example of toxicity.
    I once had a software engineering job where I was dealing with toxicity to such an extent that I was seriously thinking about changing my profession.
    Afterward, I took a break for two months. To make things worse the toxic person was in a senior position, and
    I was still a junior, so this power gap was not really helpful.
    So how did it get so far and why did I not quit earlier? There are many things I keep telling myself, but
    honestly, it was probably just laziness and complacency to find something different. We humans are pretty good at rationalizing
    situations and trying to find comfort. One factor that made these days frustrating and exhausting was the coworking
    circumstances (and probably Covid). I was dealing with that person for
    8 hours straight every single day. Our team did mob programming, and frankly, I would never ever want to go back to pair for
    such a long time. Just a quick explanation for those who are not in the tech industry:
    The term mob programming describes a technique of programming where three or more developers try to solve a problem.
    One person is writing the code, while the others are researching and directing.
    Now, interacting with people drains energy, and I am just not capable of dealing every second of my workday with
    humans. Don't get me wrong I enjoy interacting with coworkers, and it is a great way to learn. But
    spending time alone to solve problems is really important too.
    Oftentimes, toxic coworkers might cross our path for a few minutes maybe an hour
    in total. But being exposed to toxicity for this long can be detrimental. Because as you might have already
    expected, we adapt to the people we spend a lot of time with. I am not certain that we have no tools to prevent
    this influence from changing us.
    However, I am almost certain that we would need to invest a lot of resources and time to undo these experiences.
    Now I want to provide some signs of toxicity and how they impacted me in the course of a few months. I can only
    speak for myself here and my anecdotal experience.
  </p>
  <div class="content__subtitle">Ghosting</div>
  <p>
    So in the last paragraph, I rambled about how I spent 8 hours a day with a toxic person, and now you probably think
    how does that even relate to the concept of ghosting. Let me explain: I don't mean ghosting in the classical sense
    like for example in the dating scene - where one person just stops interacting with the other person. I mean it more in the sense that
    every time disagreement bottles up one person just stops interacting. He just stopped responding to any questions or
    refrained from discussing the topic any further.
    This was not due to shyness, he used this technique deliberately.
    This happened several times during the day, and it slowly changed my inner attitude towards discussions and conflicts.
    These things are already difficult by their nature, but ghosting discussions in the workplace is destructive towards
    the end goal and the humans involved.
  </p>
  <div class="content__subtitle">Constant belittlement</div>
  <p>
    One key factor in the interactions with the coworker was the constant belittlement I experienced.
    Name-calling were daily reminders that something was not right, and he often criticized how little I could remember.
    Don't get me wrong, this is not meant as a complaint or to portray me as a victim. But these daily naggings are
    going to pile up over time. In the beginning, you might not realize it, but the longer it continues the more
    you start to doubt yourself. Even if the other person is delivering insults as a joke, none of this should be acceptable.
    Coworkers should help each other and not put each other down.
  </p>
  <div class="content__subtitle">No interest in resolutions</div>
  <p>
    Another key characteristic of toxicity is the inability to say sorry or to admit any wrongdoing.
    This is a crucial aspect because it leaves no chance of dispute resolution.
    Toxic people are not interested in resolving conflicts and showing vulnerabilities.
    They feel superior in their profession, and this superiority feeling leads them to assume that they don't have
    to apologize. Paradoxically, the software industry relies on so-called sprint retrospectives.
    These are essentially sessions, where all problems and successes from the last 2-4 weeks are discussed.
    This retro should also include intrapersonal problems and should help resolve any tensions between team members.
    However, as you might have thought this is oftentimes either completely skipped or many problems are just not
    talked about.
  </p>
  <div class="content__subtitle">Surrender</div>
  <p>
    My best excuse for continuing to work was always: "I might suffer now, but he probably teaches me great stuff.
    So this is acceptable". Yeah, talk about self-respect. This is an absolute garbage excuse and please don't make that mistake.
    There are so many workplaces where you can learn stuff. Just because someone is more experienced than you does not
    mean that they are entitled to behave in such ways. At one stage I just completely surrendered to the situation and
    accepted that my days were filled with these destructive interactions. The funny thing about this is that during this
    time I was not really thinking: "I am not happy here, and I should change that". It was rather a subtle shift
    in my behavior. In hindsight, there were many signals that I was getting pretty unhappy overall. My symptoms were:
  </p>
  <div class="numeration">
      <div class="numeration__item">- Latching out on people after work - especially those I live with</div>
      <div class="numeration__item">- No desire to do any programming besides work </div>
      <div class="numeration__item">- Counting hours until I can finally leave the conference call</div>
      <div class="numeration__item">- Distraction after work, so I don't need to confront my uneasiness</div>
  </div>
  <div class="content__subtitle">Final words</div>
  <p>
    I hope you value yourself and your time so that you don't spend time with toxic people.
    These situations have taught me a lot, but honestly, I would not accept such behavior anymore.
    We only have so much time on this earth and even if this sounds cheesy, we should not let toxic behavior
    dictate our inner life. On the other side, I feel really sorry for toxic people. They might carry huge
    burdens or their life was thrown upside-down through external circumstances.
    We should always strive to help and understand each other, but
    don't tie our self-worth to the reactions of those people. This could be generalized: Don't let your
    inner life be influenced by the reaction of other people.
