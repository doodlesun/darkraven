        <p>
            In recent years I have often encountered the claim that there are no values without religion
            and that society is doomed if we all just abandoned religion.
            I do understand the fear that is associated with this claim as I have been raised in a religious
            household. However, this initial fear subsided after leaving religion behind and building your own
            set of morals. This post is not intended to persuade you to give up your faith. So please don't feel attacked,
            I just want to address this concern because I have lived through such a value crisis. My overall position is that
            values are subjective and that there is no objective morality, and I am not trying to argue why I think objective morality
            doesn't exist. Even if you disagree with that premise you might still appreciate the conclusion.
        </p>
        <div class="content__subtitle">Origin of values</div>
        <p>
            So where do we derive our values from if we do not accept that they are god-given? Do we just jog on and react to situations?
            I would argue most people do that already, and you are probably no exception. It is often stated that
            people have a moral framework and act according to it, but I would argue that most of our behavior is learned and
            deeply ingrained in "human nature". This is probably what Sam Harris meant when he said that
            morality is objective because humans have similar values irrespective of their cultural upbringing. I would not call this
            proof for objective morality, rather as an evolutionary trait that has developed when we became social animals.
            But as I said, I am not here trying to persuade you that there is such a thing as objective morality or not.
            So how do we find our values if they are not god-given?
        </p>
        <div class="content__subtitle">Starting point</div>
        <p>
            Now you need to do the work. If you reject the morality of the bible, you have to start searching for your own.
            You could start by defining your morality based on the laws of the country you live in. However, this has
            some nasty downsides. First, it means that you stop thinking and give the government power over your morality.
            I would argue that this is disastrous, and you should use your brain (and empathy) to figure out your moral code.
            Second, it means that your values could change in any instance. Luckily, I don't think anybody does this in reality
            and this should be a good thing. So if we can not rely on the government who can inspire good moral conduct in us?
            I would argue that most people adopt their childhood learnings about right and wrong and that's about it.
            Do nothing nasty to other people, be honest most of the time. Yet, this might not satisfy you. So you go
            deeper you read about Kant's categorical imperative and think that this is it. This is the golden rule, we
            found it. But then you think about edge cases that sound pretty disastrous when applied rigorously.
            Take the classic - you are hiding Anne Frank in your basement and the nazis ask you if
            you have anything to hide - for example. The categorical imperative would imply that you should tell the truth because telling
            the truth can be made a universal maxim. Or it says you are allowed to lie and this is totally fine in this case.
            But how long is this behavior a universal maxim? If a friend invites me to his party, and I lie because I
            am uncomfortable with saying no, then is this an acceptable situation?
            Now, this makes you really itchy, it doesn't feel right
            (and you are probably onto something here). But how on earth do we get to a consistent moral framework?
            Hint: We don't, everyone is making imperfect moral judgments, and even if you would have all the available information
            you would still have to deal with cases that provoke conclusions that would probably make you feel uncomfortable.
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley</a> problem was not invented to make us all feel cozy.
            And that is absolutely fine, most humans have a decent understanding of which moral code they should follow.
            Most of that is - don't do things that you would not want to be done unto you. Of course, these practical approaches
            have downsides and nobody will make perfect decisions with them.
        </p>
        <div class="content__subtitle">So is religion the superior framework?</div>
        <p>
            All of the previous ramblings hint at the idea that religion is the superior moral framework compared to 'wing it on the go'.
            I would argue that this is not the case, for one the bible has some really horrific moral ideas. Like the idea that
            it is okay to hit your slave if he is not dying of it (Exodus 21:20-21). Seriously, you need to do some brain gymnastics to get out of that one.
            Our collective modern understanding would probably suggest that this is not the right way to go about things.
            Yeah, not only the hitting part, but you know a lot of people fought and died so that we do not view people as possessions.
            The bible might have some good ideas about morals, but that does not make it a good moral framework. I could come up
            with rules to live by which you might wholeheartedly agree with that does not mean that I could build a good framework.
            It just means that we all have some intuitive understanding of what is 'right' or 'wrong' and the authors of the bible
            had some good thoughts too (besides the obvious crazy stuff).
            Heck, the bible is pretty poor in being a good guide in life. If you are living according to the bible
            you will inevitably encounter some real dilemmas, like respecting other people's life choices (hint: LGQBT, homosexuality, abortion, and the list goes on).
            Yes, I said that I will not bash the holy book, but some stuff is just too mind-blowing to let it slip.

        <div class="content__subtitle">Morality is a life-long learning process</div>
        <p>
            Our values transform during different life stages as we try to conceptualize our experiences.
            Even if you have studied multiple frameworks from utilitarianism to Kant and consequentialism, you have to make compromises in your framework
            and the more you think about them the more you realize that this is mostly theoretical masturbation and
            real life is just so messy. Take me as an example, I would have ascribed myself to being a negative utilitarian
            (in a nutshell minimizing suffering before maximizing pleasure). However, utilitarianism is mostly like spreadsheet wrestling.
            Meaning that you can never really 'know' what action has more utility because real life is so complex and
            most things don't carry a label with +10 extra points for preventing suffering. Accept this fact of life,
            use daily situations to practice gratitude and understanding, and then find a way of interacting with the world
            that works for you and the people you interact with. After all morality is a life-long learning process,
            you probably have different values now than you had 5 years prior, and that is totally acceptable.
            Life is about uncertainty and morality is just one field which is touched by it.
            Respect other beings, respect yourself and enjoy life!
