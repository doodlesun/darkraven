            You and I are both not experts in most fields. We have probably no deeper understanding of
            climate change, renewable energy, electrical engineering, medicine, nutrition, yeah you get the gist of it.
            Maybe you are an expert in one of those fields, but you are certainly not an expert in all of them.
            It is impossible to know enough about topics you do not invest most of your time in. Your day has 24 hours,
            if you are a good citizen, you sleep 7-8, work 8-9 and eat roughly 2 hours. So that leaves you with 5-6 hours of free time.
            At this point, you didn't even have time to do anything besides your basic activities. Sport, friends, and family
            have not yet allocated any of your time. You see, time in a day is scarce, and we might be experts in our work.
            But oftentimes this is a highly specialized field, and it mainly covers one small part of a vast area.
            What I am getting at is that we have no time to be knowledgeable in other topics. Yes, we have opinions,
            but these opinions are often based on hearsay. Someone told me a 'fact' and my brain goes, that is a fact
            I am going to believe it because it is a lot easier than asking hard questions or thinking deeply about it.
            It conserves energy, and we all love to conserve energy. Humans are good at lying to themselves, we fantasize
            about all the topics we are going to explore in the future because in the future we will have the willpower
            and the time to do it. Of course, this is a common delusion. Time is always scarce, and willpower is always scarce,
            especially if you have completed your basic activities. That sounds really negative and doomy, but it is actually not.
            It is just important to acknowledge that we all operate on a minuscule amount of information on a day-to-day basis.
            Learning about all important life topics is just too overwhelming, and we have no choice other than to
            listen to experts in their respective fields.
        </p>
        <div class="content__subtitle">Our opinions are our beliefs</div>
        <p>
            So most of the stuff that we accept as truth is just a belief that we adopted throughout our lifetimes.
            Let's start with a simple example. I believe that the earth is round. Some people think that
            the earth is flat. Why do I believe that the earth is round? Because I have learned my whole life that
            we are living on a sphere object and physics and astrology tell us that the earth is an ellipsoid.
            Essentially I just repeated what I had learned in school and from my education. I never really tried to
            disprove or prove this theory. Now, this is where contrarians see the problem, they might say: "Hey you
            just repeat what the governing elite wants you to think and this is actually all factual wrong. We have
            proof that the earth is flat, and we have answers to all your questions." Then they might go on to explain
            to you that gravitation is just you falling down through the universe and that the earth falls through space
            with you. Funnily enough, this explanation is partially true. Now, you might object and say: "I saw pictures of the earth and every space agency in the world
            thinks that the earth is a sphere". But to them, this is just a confirmation of their ideas. They are all in
            this conspiracy together, they are all complicit and this is an open secret. Now I don't think agencies around
            the world are all in one this one. Just imagine what this would mean and on what scale such secrets would be kept.
            Countries can not even keep their most important secrets from the public eye, and we are to believe that
            thousands of people have been persuaded to participate in this grand scheme? I highly doubt this, but
            this is of course no proof. Why do I bring this example up? Because it illustrates how two opposing views
            are based on pure belief. One is probably more correct than the other, but from an objective standpoint,
            these opinions are based on the same foundation. An underlying belief that was formed and has not been
            rigorously verified. Yes yes yes, I know you are getting impatient and want to say that there are lots of proofs
            that the earth is an ellipsoid
            (shout out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum">Leon Foucault</a>). I get it,
            if we put in a decent amount of effort we can dispel the myth of the flat earth. But it is time-consuming and harder
            than most people think. Most importantly, the vast majority of people do not verify their beliefs, it
            is still more correct to believe that the earth is a sphere than it is to think that we are walking on
            a flat object and could fall off its corners. Nonetheless, both parties engage in the same activity.
            They have a basic assumption/belief - the earth is flat/round - and then deepen this belief throughout
            their life. I think this is why we see so many people falling prey to alluring-sounding conspiracy
            theories. Our opinions are based on what feels right and what aligns with our worldview.
            We think of ourselves as rational beings, but we are far from it. Facts/Proofs have little attraction
            to our monkey brain. Researching a topic such as climate change is a daunting task. There are many experts
            in the fields and the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/">IPCC</a> report is massive.
            Understanding the mechanics and details of climate change is an unfathomable task for us mortals who
            are not working in the field. We can never be certain that what we are believing is factual because
            we can not derive our knowledge from primary sources, rather we rely on secondary or tertiary
            sources who take the time to translate the science into average intelligence reports and articles.
        </p>
        <div id="heuristics" class="content__subtitle">All hail the experts</div>
        <p>
            I suggested that we should rely on experts, but is that a wise decision?
            There is even a fallacy named after this, which is called
            <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority">the appeal to authority bias</a>.
            Crazy conspiracy theories oftentimes have
            so-called experts on their side who present studies that seem supportive of their idea.
            This is where it gets really tricky because now we have to actually use our brain and
            discern con-mans from an actual scientist. How do we do that? There is no blueprint, but I can suggest a
            few ideas that I have come up with.<br/>
            First, evaluate how these experts interact with other experts in the field.
            This is often a good approximation of their trustworthiness and as a bonus point, it uses a trait that
            we all already have - our social intuition. I know, I know you are already blasting out that this
            is deemed to failure because narcissists and sociopaths know how to manipulate people. And I kind of agree,
            however, if this expert dismisses all his peers` work and postulates that he is the only source of truth.
            Then you better get going, because he is probably full of bs. Science often makes big leaps when
            scientists question the status quo, so this rule might be wrong, but these rare events are the exception, not the rule.<br/>
            Another red flag that touches on this first point is that some experts openly state that there are
            no facts that can convince them otherwise. This is dogma and throws all rationality out of the window.
            If an expert is not willing to change his mind if he is presented with evidence which contradicts his
            belief then how can we rely on his expertise?<br/>
            Second, if you have a topic that is very controversial even among the top scientists, then you might want to
            take a look at the data and see what the researchers on the topic are saying. There are different scientific methodologies,
            and they all have their place, but you want to look for meta-analysis or human trials. Roughly the
            strength of evidence goes like this meta-analysis > human trials > animal studies > in vivo > in vitro studies.
            This is not an exhaustive comparison there are also dozens of study designs and other methodologies.
            The important part here is to look for the actual data and then read at least the abstract and the conclusion.
            Yeah, I know this is what every serious scientific person warns you about as you cannot evaluate the study
            because we lack the necessary background. Further, the abstract and conclusion
            might be wrong or inconclusive based on the data. Still, this is better than blindly following
            everything other people say, especially on social media.<br/>
            Third, use platforms that do the work for you. Now this will sound like an ad, and I apologize, but it is one
            of the best platforms to look up a rather unbiased scientific opinion. I am in no way affiliated with them.
            I get absolutely nothing for recommending this here, but they are absolute legends at
            <a href="https://examine.com">examine.com</a>. They are mainly focused on nutrition and
            supplements, so if this is not of interest to you go and skip ahead.
        </p>
        <div class="content__subtitle">Dunning Kruger</div>
        <p>
            So this might sound really strange, but we have to talk about the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning Kruger effect</a>.
            To cite the Wikipedia entry:
            "The Dunning–Kruger effect is the cognitive bias whereby people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability."
            Hey look that's me :). Yes seriously, I often suffer from this in topics where I have not put in the work, and that's
            like 99% of topics in this world. Why do I bring this up? Because social media is full of people who
            are victims of their own ignorance. Now comes the interesting part: Especially people that are experts in
            one topic are prone to be completely dumbfounded in other areas. They just don't realize that they are leaning
            into stuff that is well beyond their intellectual capabilities. We all make this mistake all the time, but you know
            it is not so bad if Pete from the bar on a Saturday thinks he knows everything about everything. It is
            dangerous if people who have a following because of their expertise in one area have plentiful opinions on
            complex topics that they are not well versed in. This is especially bad if they are experts in their
            respective fields because they might be more susceptible to biases. Oftentimes experts are overconfident in
            their intellectual capabilities which are outside their expertise, this is why we often see
            people on social media who are experts in one topic arguing passionately about topics where they
            are not deeply knowledgeable. This is a common occurrence, and I am sure most readers have already
            experienced situations that are similar to this. Yet, this is not meant to dismiss the opinions of people
            who are not experts, opinions should be evaluated based on their argumentation and not based on the person
            stating them.
        </p>
        <div class="content__subtitle">What can be done?</div>
        <p>
            There are probably 3 things you should think about:
        </p>
            <ol>
            1. What topics are you really passionate about and which topics do you think are really important to be
            knowledgeable in? Go all-in on these topics and try to learn as much as you can. Do not only read expert opinions.
            Go to the primary source and read it, try to understand the mechanism from the first principle. Accept that you
            will never be as knowledgeable as someone who dedicates their life to this work. Be content with what you know
            and strive for a better understanding.
            </ol>
            <ol>
            2. What topics are only partially interesting to you? Use heuristics to follow the most trustworthy experts.
            Look at the <a href="#heuristics">heuristics</a> again. Go to Twitter and find people who are the leading experts in this field.
            Listen to podcasts with these people.
            Find out where the experts disagree and then form your own opinion based on their explanation. You will only
            scratch the surface here. There is no deep knowledge possible.
            </ol>
            <ol>
            3. These are the things you actively avoid. Yes, I mean to avoid. You should be aware that there is enough
            knowledge to fill endless lifetimes. We don't have that. Yes, I am looking at you, longevity research, right now.
            So be conscious about what you don't want. I mean you don't have to literally run away when someone talks
            about such topics, but when you have decided that this is not of interest to you, make sure to prioritize.
            </ol>
