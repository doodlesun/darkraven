        <div class="content__subtitle">The suffering of sentient beings</div>

        <p>
        I have been a carnivore for most of my life and
        only switched to a vegetarian lifestyle three years ago.
        I did not only like meat, but I was also proud of it, the diet was part of my identity.
        Vegetarians and vegans were strange people in my world view
        who just didn't understand that nature is cruel and animals are for human consumption.<br/>

        My vegetarian journey began three years ago and since December 2020
        I am also trying to adhere to a diet free of animal
        products (veganism).
        Please, question everything you read here, and if you find anything that
        is contradicting feel free to contact me.<br/>

        Most of these ideas are adapted from Peter Singer,
        Alex O'Conner, and <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org">Brian Tomasik</a>.
        If you haven't read Peter Singer I would highly suggest giving it a try.
        He was it in the first place that convinced me
        that we must consider animals in our moral landscape.<br/>

        Veganism has a bad reputation because it is often seen as a cult or religion
        which is what repels people from giving it any thought or a throughout examination.
        A lot of things that I bring forth might offend you,
        but please think about them and evaluate the merits of each argument.<br/>
        I am not particularly fond of the vegan community, even though this is of course
        an unfair generalisation. But oftentimes I can not really relate to the online culture.
        Moral topics are complex, and I often find that the vegan community appeals too much to emotions
        (which I am guilty of in this article). Discussions about veganism depend on the moral framework of each
        individual. I do not really consider morality to be objective which makes this discussion even more difficult.<br/>

        However, I want to start with a definition of veganism.
        To quote Wikipedia: "Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of
        animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects
        the commodity status of animals.
        An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan."
        This definition seems sufficient to continue the discussion of veganism.
        To shorten this into bullet points it has 2 important points:<br>
        </p>
        <div class="numeration">
            <div class="numeration__item">- no animal products </div>
            <div class="numeration__item">- animals are no commodity </div>
        </div>
        <p>
        One thing is really important to remember: Veganism is not a diet,
        it is a lifestyle that chooses to minimize the suffering of sentient beings.
        </p>
        <div class="content__subtitle">Morals</div>

        <p>
        The following points are based on my moral principles, mainly to avoid suffering
        in sentient beings.
        I would not call myself a stringent utilitarian because I don't think that there
        is a strict moral currency that can be applied to situations.
        However, I do think that utilitarianism has some interesting concepts.
        Furthermore, I would see my morals more on the ground of negative utilitarianism
        because I do think that suffering is to be avoided and that suffering outweighs
        pleasue in most circumstances.<br/>
        Nonetheless, I think strict utilitarianism will lead to extreme views
        and assumptive conclusions.
        Now that we have some background on my morals, I want to present arguments
        <strong>against</strong> veganism.
        </p>

        <div class="content__subtitle">Discussion of arguments against veganism</div>

        <div class="content__subtitle2">Culture and nature</div>

        <p>
        I like to start with a common attack against vegans that eating animals is
        part of the culture and a natural way of living.
        This first argument is a bandwagon fallacy
        (see <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/bandwagon">here</a>).
        Appealing to culture or that everyone is doing it can be easily dismantled by
        stating that we also used to have slaves or that women had fewer rights than men.
        In the context of culture, there is no sound moral justification/explanation as to
        why we can abolish slavery,
        but not the killing of billions of innocent sentient beings.
        Humans have always adapted to new cultures and laws, otherwise we would not be living
        in such a society as today.<br/>

        Especially the natural argument has always baffled me because
        what exactly does "natural" mean?
        Is flying in airplanes natural? Is driving in cars natural?
        What is this natural way we seek to live?
        Should we all be living in caves and kill each other over food and women?
        A definition of natural is pretty damn difficult, and I don't think it bears any value.
        Maybe the obsession with natural/nature stems from religious contexts as nature
        can be viewed as something sacred. Something that should not be interfered with.
        My views on religion are not discussed in this blog, but I will probably write an article
        in the future. As you might have guessed it there is also a fallacy for this type of argument, namely
        <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature">appeal to nature</a><br/>
        Maybe what people mean with natural is that we can only get sufficient nutrients
        with an omnivore diet as we might have evolved to eating meat.
        But does this hold up with the current recommendations of official health institutes?
        </p>

        <div class="content__subtitle2">Nutrition deficits</div>

        <p>
        I am by no means a certified nutritionist, so you might want to skip this chapter
        as I can only repeat what official sources are telling.
        Many institutes like the American Dietetic Association <a href="#references">[1]</a>,
        the Dietitians Australia <a href="#references">[2]</a>, and the Paedriatics Child
        Health <a href="#references">[3]</a> state that vegan diets can be healthy.
        However, they do also state that it requires additional considerations such as
        supplementing essential vitamins such as B12 (Zinc, Iod, Calcium, etc.).
        This does not sound like veganism is an unhealthy or dangerous diet. Nonetheless,
        it requires some additional effort from the consumer.
        Now you might think that this is not worth the hustle, but hold on for a short
        as we will explore the benefits later on.<br/>
        For completeness sake I want also to include that the DGE (Germany) does not
        recommend a vegan diet "during pregnancy or lactation, or for children or
        adolescents of any age." <a href="#references">[4]</a>
        Their main reason seems to be that it is easier to be malnourished with a vegan
        diet, especially if one is not educated on the subject.
        However, malnutrition can also happen on an omnivore diet and most people are not
        educated on nutritional requirements.<br/>
        On a side note: If you want to get a good understanding of nutrition,
        I would highly recommend that you check out <a href="https://examine.com">www.examine.com</a>.
        I have no affiliation with them, but they are a treasure for unbiased reviews
        and recommendations.<br/>

        I think it is fair to say that most adults should be safe with a vegan diet and
        even some institutes <a href="#references">[5]</a>
        include children in their recommendations as long as they get all required nutrients.<br/>

        If you plan on going vegan, please do your research on nutrients
        and what must be supplemented for a healthy diet!
        Even if you don't hop on a vegan or vegetarian diet, nutritional education is
        super important, but be aware of snake oil salesman and unproven claims.
        </p>

        <div class="content__subtitle2">I don't care about animals or their suffering</div>

        <img src="../images/pigs.jpg" alt="pigs"/>

        <p>
        This might sound like a ridiculous statement to you, however, every person is
        entitled to her/his opinion.
        Yet, this claim is often accompanied by cognitive dissonance.
        Let me explain what I mean by that:
        Suppose you do not care about the suffering of animals.
        What about the suffering of babies and mentally disabled people?
        If you care about this why do you exclude nonhuman?
        What characteristics do animals lack that the aforementioned humans do have?
        A lot of animals like pigs do have similar cognitive/emotional/social abilities
        as children <a href="#references">[6]</a>.<br/>
        Yet we do only consider the latter as worthy of living and the other as a commodity.
        The word I am referring to here is speciesism.
        Granting moral value to humans, but not to other species such as pigs or chickens.
        Sentient beings do not derive their moral worth through being part of a species
        or race, rather we might derive moral worth of a being through the
        capabilities of said being to experience suffering.
        Granting special rights to species is a very dangerous place as it draws a moral arbitrary line.
        Furthermore, if you are using genetic composition as a measurement of your eating preferences
        then it might surprise you that we share most of our genes with mammals
        and other related animals.
        </p>

        <div class="content__subtitle">Arguments for veganism</div>

        <div class="content__subtitle2">Moral considerations</div>

        <p>
        Because we can derive all nutrients from a vegan diet,
        the most compelling argument for eating animal products' is the taste of their meat.
        (However if I am missing other considerations please let me know!).
        So the question we have to ask every time we eat a product where an animal has
        been abused is the following: Does the pleasure of the taste justify
        the suffering of a being?
        Honestly, I find it pretty difficult to morally defend the taste of something
        against the suffering of this being.
        In the beginning, I mentioned utilitarianism and how I think a value currency is
        unrealistic to define.
        It might be difficult to compare the pleasure during eating with the suffering
        associated with that pleasure, but due to alternatives and the ever-growing
        industry around replacement products, it is morally difficult to argue
        that animal products have to be part of our diet.
        Here, I would also state the cognitive dissonance many people in our society
        embrace: On the one hand, eating animals like pigs and chickens is morally justifiable and on the other
        hand we are welcoming dogs into our family homes and frown upon cultures who eat said animals.
        What are the moral justifications for this judgement and behavior?
        They surely can not be due to the cognitive/emotional/social abilities of these
        animals. As pigs are similar to dogs in this regard.
        I understand that this behavior can be explained culturally and some animals are just unlucky
        to not have been born as a human companion. Even though a lot of dogs are also living miserable lives
        on the streets or are victim to over breeding just to die a gruesome death.

        <p>
        I don't want to go into details here because it is not the main point of this
        article, but for completeness, I will use a citation without commentary:
        "All told, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with livestock supply
        chains add up to 7.1 gigatonnes (GT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) per
        year - or 14.5 percent of all human-caused GHG releases." <a href="#references">[7]</a>
        </p>

        <div class="content__subtitle2">Wild animal suffering</div>

        <p>
        I am having difficulties fathoming the innumerable suffering in the wild.
        It is probably several factors greater compared to all animal
        mass-producing facilities.
        Natural selection is brutal. Species produce
        many offsprings so that a few can survive. Starvation and being eaten
        are probably the leading causes of death and most of these are associated
        with a prolonged period of suffering. But what can we do about this?
        Honestly, I currently don't know and my best guess is that research
        and science can provide partial answers to these problems, but we might never be able to
        grapple the complexity of such topics.
        The only thing I am certain about is that these topics should be discussed.
        However, we have to be cautious that our actions will not produce more
        suffering because of the complexities involved. Intervening in nature can always have
        negative consequences and we humans do not have the best track record.<br/>

        <div class="content__subtitle">What is left?</div>

        <p>
        I hope this short introduction to veganism has sparked some discussion inside
        you and if not I hope you will sometimes revisit the arguments.
        Veganism is often portrayed as a radical lifestyle, it might be argued that
        eating sentient beings and their products can be defined as a more radical
        lifestyle. We are used to it, and we think it is acceptable because everyone
        is doing it.
        Change is only possible if we question our beliefs and values and act accordingly.
        My dearest hope is that future generations will look at our times and be
        disgusted by the way we treated animals.<br/>
        Finally, I want to spark your imagination, think about being a pig in
        a mass production facility.
        From birth on you are treated as an object, your world consists of feces,
        dirt, and steel fences that prevent you from moving any further than a few meters.
        You have no connection to your mother because she was confined to a tiny spot
        to lay down and produce milk for you and your siblings.
        Some of your siblings were too weak to survive so a worker
        from the facility killed them with a few hits on the head.
        You are numb, you know nothing of this world. The older you get,
        the heavier you become. You are crammed with other fellow pigs and moving around
        or playing outside is not possible.
        These workers are stressed out and sometimes seem very angry with you.
        But you have no idea why. Then comes the day when you are put into a transporter
        and brought to a house where people use sticks to hit you so that you move in
        the right direction. This place is even smaller than the old one.
        You lay on the concrete and everything hurts.
        Some of your fellow beings seem exhausted from the travel.
        The next morning some worker uses sticks to bring you and nine others to another
        room. But somehow he closes the door behind you. Suddenly, you can't breathe anymore,
        you get irritated, you cry out for help, your fellow companions do the same.
        But there is nothing other than sterile machines and metallic noises.
        You panic, stumble and after a while of this excruciating pain, you become unconscious.
        The worker puts a strap around your legs which pulls you up and another worker
        sticks a knife into your throat which makes you bleed to death.<br/>

        I don't like arguments that appeal to emotions because it might suppress the
        rational side of the argument.
        However, this is the reality we live in and the package in the supermarket does not
        tell you anything about it. Even worse it displays happy animals
        in nature who have nothing in common with the majority of animals that are
        slaughtered for their meat.
        This or similar experiences are the reality for billions of animals every year.
        There is no clean consciousness. We are part of this problem.
        No cognitive dance can mitigate the reality. These beings suffer for our pleasure.
        I can not go on living like we are gods to these animals and without doing
        anything about these atrocities. Think for yourself and if you do not like to suffer
        why should they like to suffer? I was born so privileged and the chances that I
        happened to be where I am now are so small,
        I could as well have been born in a war-torn region
        or as an animal that experiences only suffering and death.
        We have done nothing to deserve this privilege, but we can use it to help other
        beings. Mass production and wild animal suffering are immediate problems.
        The former can be solved by our consumption, the latter needs many intelligent
        people for researching and finding solutions to complex problems.
        But you have a choice right now.
