   <strong>Edit: I am currently in an internal debate if I can get more out of compatibilism than I initially attributed
   to it. Most philosophers are compatibilists and I think this alone is a strong indicator that there is more
   to the concept than I currently understand.</strong><br><br>
   Let me start out with a disclaimer:
   If you are easily disturbed by philosophical concepts
    that might influence your day-to-day life,
    I would advise you to skip this article.
    This is not meant to say that this article is life changing.
    However, these ideas can be unpleasant.
    I am speaking from experience.
    Ten years ago, I was first introduced to the illusion
    of free will. But only recently have I accepted the conclusion from
    this debate. I am no longer worried by its implication, but
    you might be and this is enough of a reason to stop reading.
    There is a right time in one's life to come across these ideas and if
    you are not feeling ready, feel free to skip. Also take everything
    I write with a grain of salt. I am fallible and do
    not have any high grounds on this debate. If you are
    extra nice, contact me and tell me about my reasoning flaws.
    This way I can improve my writing and thinking.
    The topic of free will is complicated and there are
    many aspects to it which I might not have considered
    or I am not even aware of (you know the unknown unknowns <a href="#references">[2]</a>).

    This discussion is heavily influence by
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4Oyi1T-HmU">Rationality Rules</a>
    , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwaXqep-bpk">CosmicSkeptic</a>
    and the Free Will book by Sam Harris.
    With that being said, let's jump right into it.
   </p>
   <div class="content__subtitle">Definition</div>

   <p>
    Free will is not really easy to define and your version
    might slightly differ from mine. But so that we have a clear ground for elaboration
    my definition goes as follows:
    <strong>Free will is the ability to have acted differently in a given situation.</strong>
    This is still pretty vague, but it provides some good ground for further distinctions.
    What I mean by 'to have acted differently' is that if you make a decision in a situation
    and then rewind time and space, so that you relive the moment without any knowledge
    of your future
    self then you have the ability to decide differently. Even though it is the exact
    same situation with the universe in the exact same spot (atoms, particles...).
   </p>
   <div class="content__subtitle">My framework for evaluating free will</div>
   <p>
   My stance is derived from the naturalistic viewpoint.
    Which is roughly that there are known forces that
    rule our lives like atoms, particles and the interaction of those.
    We are part of the system and not outside of it so
    we are also bound to physical laws and not exempt from them.
    The chain of causality is an important concept of this
    elaboration as well. I do not consider ideas like a soul or
    other unknown forces that might be the source of your free will.
    Even though I agree with Sam Harris on the point that
    the soul would in no way proof free will.
    Moreover, there is no evidence for a soul, and therefore I don't think
    it is too relevant for this discussion. Of course this argument
    is a clever cop out because what you can not prove nor disprove
    is an easy position to take. This version is often used by religious people
    as such they try to mitigate the evidence against free will.
    This position might be described as "God gave us free will because he is
    gracious, and thus we do have free will".
    This argument depends on different preconditions.
    First you would have to prove that there is a god and second that she/he/it gave
    us free will to begin with. The mere presence of a god is no argument for free will.
    </p>
   <div class="content__subtitle">The problem with the meaning of free will</div>
   <p>
   The concept of free will is a difficult one to grasp if you
    rationally think about it. We take it for granted that
    we have free will and that we are the agents of our decisions.
    This intuition runs deeply. Even though I do intellectually
    understand that I do not have free will, I am living like I do
    have a free will, because my brain is so accustomed to this idea.
    However, if you think about what the concept of free will entails,
    namely that there is something inside you that is not in the
    realm of causality makes the concept deeply flawed.
    Where does this agency come from if it is not part of the
    physical world, because if your will is derived from your brain and it's
    composition which acts based on physical laws, then where does this
    agency originates from? Further, if such an entity would exist
    what is the origin of it? What is the source of a rational brain that
    can make choices independent of the physical world?
    The concept is hard to grasp because true free will is
    not really imaginable in our current world.
    </p>
    <div class="content__subtitle">The origin of your will</div>
   <p>
   My previous point touches on the problem of the source of free will.
    If you brain is just composed of atoms acting on each other and
    behaving according to physical laws without some other source
    of agency then there can not be any free will. As stated, religions evade
    this problem with the concept of the soul, but I am not even
    remotely convinced by this concept. Because it is not falsifiable
    meaning that it can never be disproved.
    But where does your will come from? Why do you make decisions?
    It all boils down to desire. You decide based on your desires.
    You might think this a spectacular simplification of life,
    but think about any decision you made in the recent past.
    They are all based on your desires.
    Let's look at an example:
    You go and get some ice cream with your friends,
    now the person serving you the ice cream asks you what you would like.
    You think: "I really like chocolate, but I also like strawberry".
    Then you choose chocolate because it suits you best in this situation.
    Where does this choice come from? It is based on your desires.
    Maybe you decided because in your childhood you loved chocolate ice cream.
    Further you might be inclined to sweeter ice cream because your
    taste buds are especially receptive to sweeter ice cream.
    In any case you decision did not come
    out of thin air, it is based on your desire that you have formed at some previous
    time in your life and which might have originated long before you were aware
    that you prefer chocolate. What I try to bring across here is that decisions
    are based on desires and you did never actively "choose" these desires.
    Your mind persuades you that this was a free decision and you are the agent
    of this decision, but where does this freedom come from?
    I would like to circle back with this example to the definition of free will.
    If we rewind time and space such that you are in the exact same spot
    with exact the same constellation of your brain cells composed of the same
    atoms. Even the universe is in the same state as in the original situation.
    Do you really think that you could "choose" strawberry, do you think
    you can uphold the physical world based on some concepts of an
    invisible force we are not aware of yet that might give you the
    ability to choose? Every day our brain tricks us into thinking that
    we could have chosen differently, but imagining alternate versions of
    the future is no proof of a free will. It just means your brain
    is weighing different options. The "self" is nothing more than
    a really complex machine that still is bound to the physical laws.
    Now you might say hold on for a second, choosing ice cream is not
    really something important. I make a deliberate decision if I
    weigh different options in complex situation, so that means
    I exercise my free will. This is a good point, but again
    you're weighing a decision is just you trying to maximize your
    desires. These desires were never chosen by "you" and even
    if you have the feeling that at some point you did choose
    to like something, it is based on some previous desire or
    predisposition that you did not choose. We are not autonomous
    agents that are not bound by physical laws, it is just
    that our brains are good at persuading us that
    we do have a free will, and it is "us" who is making
    the decisions. Now you might say: "Fine, but at least
    I chose my desires, and I am evaluating those frequently,
    and it is 'I' who decides what desires to choose".
    This is a good objection, but did you really choose
    these desires? You might like chocolate because when you first
    tried it you were really receptive to the taste overall.
    But just because you have genes that make you receptive to
    chocolate ice does not mean that you choose this desire.
    Of course, reality is a lot more complex with
    different factors influencing you. But none of
    these decisions come from an independent agent.
    </p>
    <div class="content__subtitle">Determinism </div>
   <p>
   So if we do not have free will, what is driving our actions?
    The answer might not be satisfactory for most people,
    but it is highly likely that our actions are just
    part of a chain of causality. Determinism is the name of
    the concept that I have discussed in the previous paragraphs.
    It might be deeply unsettling at first. But don't worry I will
    come back to this important point later on.
    However, the world is not truly deterministic, because physics
    has taught us a thing or two about randomness. So, reality is a lot more
    complicated than saying we are only part of a chain of deterministic
    events. Yet, I will continue to use determinism. But now you know
    that nothing is truly deterministic.
    Now that we have discovered that randomness has a role to play,
    does it save the notion of free will?
    </p>
    <div class="content__subtitle">Randomness does not rescue free will</div>
   <p>
    Now you might argue that free will is saved by randomness,
    because if there is randomness we are not able to predict the
    future from the current state. Sorry to disappoint, but
    why should randomness indicate free will? If something is
    truly random you are not the agent of this randomness, there
    is no actual will in something that is random.
    Let's make a really simplistic example:
    Again you have to decide between two sorts of ice cream.
    This time you are already sure that you want to have
    chocolate, but somehow a random event inside your brain cells
    on the particle level occurs which leads you to choose
    strawberry. How can you use randomness here to defend free will?
    Randomness does not originate from an independent agent.
    "You" (whatever that even means) did not "choose"
    strawberry. Randomness is no defense for free will.

    But maybe the concept of compatibilism which
    tries to reconcile free will and determinism can
    save us?
   </p>
    <div class="content__subtitle">My problem with compatibilism</div>
   <p>
   A lot of prominent people have resorted to the concept of
    compatibilism - e.g. Daniel Dennett. Which in essence means that determinism
    and free will are compatible.
    Wikipedia states that "[C]ompatilists often define an instance of "free will"
    as one in which the agent had freedom to act according to their own motivation.
    That is, the agent was not coerced or restrained."<a href="#references">[1]</a>
    For me this concept sounds like a cop out. Yes, we might weigh different
    options and decide based on our motivations, but this does not solve the problem
    that we never chose our desires or motivations in the first place.
    This is just a redefinition of free will. A watered down version
    of the concept of libertarian free will.
    In my opinion it is a concept to preserve the notion of
    free will, because philosophers are also just humans who might not want to
    deal with the unsettling idea of determinism.
    Our rationality does not prove that we have free will,
    weighing different options is not the slightest evidence for free will.
    Now a personal observation from watching discussions on free will
    and the proponents thereof (this is probably heavily biased):
    Every time someone tries to explain compatibilism it sounds
    like they are weaseling around the concept of free will and
    provide different analogies what compatibilism entails.
    It often sounds as a romanticized version of free will
    that makes us feel better, but it does not really
    rescue free will.
    </p>
    <div class="content__subtitle">Difference between fatalism and determinism</div>
   <p>
   Oftentimes people misunderstand these two concepts.
    Fatalism means that your future is predefined and that we could predict the future
    if we had all relevant informations (and probably computing power.
    Further we would need to solve the problem that the simulation is part of the simulation
    - we would try to simulate the universe even though the simulation device is
    also part of the simulation that it is trying to simulate - YEY).
    But determinism does not state any of this. It just says that the present state is
    defined through the past.
    This is a really important distinction.

    Furthermore, one concept that is
    heavily crushing down on fatalism is true randomness.
    Fatalism and randomness
    can not both be true. Because true randomness is obviously not predictable.
    Yet, quantum physic states that true randomness is indeed
    a reality.
    However, I don't think this distinction is really that important.
   </p>
    <div class="content__subtitle">Practicality of free will</div>
   <p>
   So, you might be inclined to say: "Yeah, we don't have free will, but
    where is the actual practicality in such philosophical discussions?
    How does it translate into my life?"
    It might be argued that there is no practical lesson in discarding free will
    and that we are just complex machines drifting through life.
    End of story. But even though determinism might sound horrifying, I want
    to propose an alternative way of embracing determinism.
    During our daily lives we live as though we have free will.
    This is nothing world shattering, as this is just our default
    brain state. It would be extraordinary difficult to remind ourselves
    that we have no free will. Further, it would probably be
    discouraging and tedious. Now comes the interesting part.
    We can use determinism to be more forgiving and patient.
    People are not acting on their own free will, they are
    just acting. This is liberating as you can use it during difficult
    conversations to remind yourself that the person sitting in front of you
    could not have acted differently. As long as people don't use it
    as an excuse to do whatever they want it is a nice tool in your
    mind shelf. Of course, there must be a limit for your patience and
    forgiveness. Don't let people make excuses without changing their behavior.
    But the concept of determinism can help you to handle difficult situations.
    To summarize, act as if you have free will, but remember that other people
    do not have free will, and you can behave more emphatically towards their mistakes.
    </p>
    <div class="content__subtitle">Further discussions</div>
    There are many topics which I can not elaborate on.
    Maybe in another life, but I want to give some food for thoughts.
    How does the acceptance of absence of free will compare to our current
    justice system (including prisons and psychological institutions)?
    How does it impact other public fields?
    Should we teach children the concept of free will and determinism?
    Can free will be rescued through unexpected findings or deeper understanding
    of the human brain?
